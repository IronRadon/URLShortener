URLShortener
=============

###Description
This is a simple CLI for interacting with the ActiveRecord models and associations that we created in class. It allows you to generate a 64 bit hash code and store it in the database to reference a URL. You can then run the script in the rails environment and either create a new shortened URL or visit a previously stored shortened URL.

###Tags
As a bonus we created a TagTopics table and Taggings table that allow the user to tag certain URLs with topic names.
